        <h1>Clean and Green Energy Portfolio - 21EEO307T</h1>
    <p>
        This portfolio has been developed as an academic requirement for the <b>Clean and Green Energy</b> course (21EEO307T) under the supervision of <b>Dr.A.Lavanya</b>. The portfolio showcases three comprehensive project activities that examine renewable energy technologies and their practical implementations. Each project demonstrates energy conversion principles, system architectures, and sustainability considerations relevant to modern environmental challenges.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The transition toward renewable energy sources has become essential in addressing climate change and energy security. This portfolio investigates three promising renewable technologies—tidal power, biogas generation, and ocean thermal conversion. The objective is to analyze their operational mechanisms, evaluate their advantages and limitations, and assess their potential contributions to sustainable development goals.

        Navigate through the sidebar menu to access the three project activities:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><b>Activity 1:</b> Tidal Energy Power Generation System Design</li>
          <li><b>Activity 2:</b> Biogas Production System Using Biomass</li>
          <li><b>Activity 3:</b> Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Power System</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        Each activity presents comprehensive documentation including system block diagrams, operational explanations, technical specifications, benefits and drawbacks, site requirements, practical applications, and analytical questions with detailed responses. This portfolio aims to provide thorough insights into how these renewable energy technologies operate and their integration possibilities for achieving global sustainability targets.
